Deep breathing (inhale 4 sec, exhale 6 sec)
5-minute mindfulness meditation
Stretch your body gently
Drink water and take a short break
Write your thoughts in a notebook
Practice box breathing (4-4-4-4)
Listen to calming music
Take sunlight exposure for 10 minutes
Reduce screen time before sleep
Talk to someone you trust
Do light physical exercise
Write 3 positive things about today
Close your eyes and relax your shoulders
Take a mindful walk outdoors
